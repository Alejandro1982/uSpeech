It currently produces vectors corresponding to the phonemes.\r\n\r\n## Minimum Requirements ##\r\nThe library is quite intensive on the processor. Each sample collection takes about 3.2 milliseconds so pay close attention to the time. Please do not perform any type of scheduling as it will disrupt the sampling. a phoneme structure takes up about 20 bytes and a recognizer structure takes up 256 bytes. The library has been tested on the Arduino Uno (ATMega328).\r\n\r\n## How to use ##\r\nIt takes some effort for making the library recognize speech. Firstly one needs a microphone with a preamplifier. The tested preamplifier used about 100-1000 times amplification. Secondly the library needs to \"learn\" the different phonemes. A tool is currently under development for this however at present this has to be done manually. More information is available on the wiki. The simplest speech recognizer looks like this:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t#include <uspeech.h>\r\n\tuspeech recognizer(A0);\r\n\tvoid setup(){\r\n  \t\tSerial.begin(9600);\r\n  \t\trecognizer.calibrate();\r\n\t}\r\n\tvoid loop(){\r\n  \t\tphoneme p= recognizer.get();\r\n  \t\tif(p.loudness()>2){\r\n    \t\tp.debugPrint();\r\n  \t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n``p.debugPrint()`` displays a vector in the serial console which corresponds to a phoneme.\r\n\r\n## Documentation ##\r\nDocumentation on this library is a work in progress. The GitHub wiki will have more on the library."}
